Currently, I am a research associate in [The School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/computer-science-and-engineering) at UNSW. I also got a PhD in Computer Scince from [Department of Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity) in Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics. Here, is my [CV](http://alipourmiri.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

I am mainly Interested in design and analysis of algorithms for network related problems including information diffudion and distributed network algorithms.
